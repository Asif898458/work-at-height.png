`üìò Fall Hazards Overview

‚Ä¢ Fall hazards include unguarded edges, floor holes, unstable ladders, and wet surfaces.

‚Ä¢ OSHA defines "at height" as 6 feet or more in construction.

‚Ä¢ Many fatal falls occur from roofs, scaffolds, or ladders.

Always evaluate:
- Where falls could happen
- What protection is required
- Who is at risk
`,
`üìò Fall Clearance & Rescue Planning

Fall Clearance = length of fall + deceleration + body height + safety margin.

Rescue Plan:
‚úî Must be written and site-specific  
‚úî Must include procedures for self and team rescue  
‚úî Should be practiced regularly  

Hanging in a harness too long can cause Suspension Trauma.  
üí° Time to rescue should be under 6 minutes if possible.
`,
`üìò PFAS Components & Use

A complete PFAS includes:
- Full-body harness  
- Anchorage point  
- Lanyard (with or without shock absorber)  
- Lifeline (if needed)

Inspect:
‚úî Before each use  
‚úî After impact  
‚úî Monthly by competent person

Never use waist belts. Always connect to dorsal D-ring.
`,
`üìò Guardrails & Ladders

Guardrails:
‚Ä¢ Top rail: 42"  
‚Ä¢ Mid rail: half-height  
‚Ä¢ Must resist 200 lbs force

Ladders:
‚Ä¢ Inspect for cracks, oil, damage  
‚Ä¢ Secure top and bottom  
‚Ä¢ Face the ladder when climbing  
‚Ä¢ Keep three points of contact
`,
`üìò Worker Rights & Employer Duties

Workers can:
‚úî File safety complaints  
‚úî Access OSHA documents  
‚úî Refuse dangerous work  
‚úî Receive hazard training

Employers must:
‚úî Provide safe workplace  
‚úî Use certified equipment  
‚úî Provide PPE at no cost  
‚úî Train in a language workers understand
`,
`üìò Summary and Final Notes

Fall protection is:
‚úî The law  
‚úî Proven to save lives  
‚úî Your right and responsibility

Common causes of fall deaths:
‚Ä¢ No PFAS  
‚Ä¢ Unprotected edges  
‚Ä¢ Unsafe ladder use
